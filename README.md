# Fetch.ai Network Upgrades

This repository contains steps and documentation aimed at **current mainnet validators** and **node operators** to migrate their nodes and upgrade the [Fetch.ai](https://fetch.ai) network to the latest version of the software.

Validators can have a review on this repo docs and scripts, this should give a good idea what will happen. 
In case of questions or issues, feel free to reach me on discord (@daeMOn#5105).
