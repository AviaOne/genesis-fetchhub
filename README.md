# Dorado Upgrade  

This repository contains steps and documentation aimed at **current mainnet validators** to migrate their nodes and upgrade the [Fetch.ai](https://fetch.ai) network to the latest (Dorado) version of the software.

Validators can have a review on this repo docs and scripts, this should give a good idea what will happen. 
In case of questions or issues, feel free to reach me on discord (@daeMOn#5105).

The scope and timeline are included in the governance proposal for this upgrade. See [https://explore-fetchhub.fetch.ai/proposals/4](https://explore-fetchhub.fetch.ai/proposals/4) for more details.

The Dorado migration scripts and procedures can be found [here](./fetchhub-4/).
